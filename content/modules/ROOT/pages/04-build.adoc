Web server’s can also host web-based applications.

Download a javascript based application and position it on your web
server.

[source,bash]
----
cd /var/www/html; git clone https://github.com/ellisonleao/clumsy-bird
----

If you are interested, you can look at the content you just downloaded
to your webserver from github.

[source,bash]
----
ls /var/www/html/clumsy-bird
----

Javascript is a language that runs on the web client’s computer. By
switching to the Clumsy Bird tab at the top of the lab interface, you
will see the code you deployed on the web server be executed by your
system’s web browser and rendered into this small video game.
