Software in Red Hat Enterprise Linux is packaged in a format called RPM.
These packages contain compiled, binary applications that are ready to
run after being installed on your system. However, applications can be
complex and require other applications or libraries in order to run. You
will use a command called DNF which will analyze RPM package files to
install not just the requested package, but all itâ€™s required
dependencies on the system.

Install the Apache Web Server software, httpd (hyper text transfer
protocal daemon):

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf -y install httpd
----

From the output above, you can see that the the package, httpd was
installed as were several required pieces of additional software.
