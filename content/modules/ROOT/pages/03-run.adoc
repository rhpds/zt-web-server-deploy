Now that you have a functioning web server, you can make it more useful
by having it serve your own content.

An html formatted file has been placed in the Document Root, the
directory that holds webserver content. Please update the file to make
it into a page that is more unique about you.

Click the following button: link:tab-2[button label="`Editor`"] tab.

The editor will automatically save changes.

After editing the file, move to the link:tab-1[button label="`Website`"]
tab. You should see your updated website content. If it still displays
the test page, please use the refresh button to get the browser to
refresh the site content.
