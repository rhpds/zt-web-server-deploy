lab:
  name: "Deploy Web Server & Apps"
  shortname: "zt-web-server-deploy"
  maintainer: "Matthew Yee (myee@redhat.com)" 
  
  description:
    summary: "Add an existing application to a Red Hat universal base image container and deploy it."
    goal: "After completing this scenario, users will be able to install additional software into a container image."
    concepts:
      - "Downloading a Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI)"
      - "Installing 3rd party software into the container image"
      - "Committing changes to create a new container image"
      - "Validating a containerized application"
    use_case: "You have a piece of software that you would like to deploy within a container image rather than installing it natively on the host system.  By using a container image, you can copy the entire environment for the software to several different hosts or run multiple copies of it on the same system."
